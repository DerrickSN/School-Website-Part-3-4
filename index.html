      <p>When the science project of the school came around, Derrick was the first to sign up. He made an amazing contraption called the looser extermanater. It was perfect and it worked just fine. He would point to any looser that he wanted to and the looser extermanater would zap it and completely erase that person from the face of the Earth. All of the teachers were so suprised that they gave him a college degree for science when he was in 5th grade.</p>
